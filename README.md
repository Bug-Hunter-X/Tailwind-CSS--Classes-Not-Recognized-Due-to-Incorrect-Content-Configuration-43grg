# Tailwind CSS: Classes Not Recognized Due to Incorrect Content Configuration

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where classes are not recognized due to an incorrectly configured `content` property in the `tailwind.config.js` file. This often leads to styling issues where your Tailwind CSS classes are not applied.

## Bug Description

The `content` property specifies the location of your HTML and JavaScript files for Tailwind to process and scan for custom classes.  If this path is incorrect, Tailwind will not find your classes and will not apply any styles.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly configuring the `content` property to point to the appropriate directories or files containing your HTML templates and components.  Use globbing patterns to ensure all relevant files are included.
